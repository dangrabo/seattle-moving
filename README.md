This project was early on in my educaton. I am aware that there are many bad practices used here. It is not
built with responsive design in mind. It also violates many style conventions such as the use of internal styling.
There is also some unnecessary JavaScript on the homepage due to a project requirement. 

I have taken many programming classes since taking the class I made this website for. I have gathered alot more
knowledge and experience regarding both front-end and back-end skills. I wanted to showcase this project because it is still my most comprehensive front-end assignment. If I were to do it again, I would have done many things differently (for instance, using 
media queries for responsive design), but this remains one of my better examples of my ability to create a full website.
